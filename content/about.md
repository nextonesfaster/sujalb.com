Hi, I'm Sujal Boliaâ€”an undergraduate who's passionate about computer science among other things, and I'm currently majoring in CS at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. I spend most of my current time working on my assignments and personal projects, trying to find opportunities to apply my classroom skills to real-world problems. I'm mostly interested in machine learning problems such as natural language processing and image processing, but I also like to dabble in algorithms and systems programming.

Outside of computer science, you can find me nerding over sports, watching anime, outdoors hiking or at a concert, or jamming out to music! Cricket is by far my favourite sport following by football, badminton, and pool.

I believe open-source software is critical for software development and try my best to contribute to the open-source community by using permissive licenses or contributing to other projects.

I'm always ready to collaborate on interesting projects, so feel free to send me an email at [sujalbolia\[at\]gmail\[dot\]com](mailto:sujalbolia@gmail.com) to get in touch! You can also reach me on Discord at `Arius#5544`.
