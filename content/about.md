Hi, I'm Sujal Bolia—a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at **AWS**, where I work on the *S3 Replication* team. Before this, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at IIT Bombay, contributing to advanced research in re-identification models and designing a versatile framework for deploying and testing ML models. I've also interned at Microsoft, where I gained practical experience in software systems and product development.

I'm deeply interested in machine learning, especially natural language processing, as well as in exploring algorithmic problems, including NP-completeness and optimization challenges. I strongly believe open-source software is critical for software development and try my best to contribute to the open-source community by using permissive licenses or contributing to other projects.

Outside of work, you can find me obsessing over sci-fi books and TV shows, and following sports—especially cricket, football, and tennis. I also love music; some of my favourite genres are hip-hop, R&B, and indie pop.

I'm always curious to work on interesting projects, so feel free to send me an email at [sujalbolia\[at\]gmail\[dot\]com](mailto:sujalbolia@gmail.com) to get in touch!
