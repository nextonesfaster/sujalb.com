Hi, I'm Sujal Bolia—a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

I'm an incoming Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I’ll be joining the AWS organization. Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at IIT Bombay, contributing to cutting-edge research in re-identification models and developing a robust, universal framework for ML model deployment and testing. I've also had the opportunity to intern at Microsoft in the summers of 2021 and 2022, gaining hands-on experience across large-scale software systems and product development.

I'm deeply interested in machine learning, especially natural language processing, as well as in exploring algorithmic problems, including NP-complete and optimization challenges. I strongly believe open-source software is critical for software development and try my best to contribute to the open-source community by using permissive licenses or contributing to other projects.

Outside of work, you can find me getting psyched by sci-fi books and tv shows and sports—cricket, football, badminton, and tennis. I also love music, some of my favourite genres include hip-hop, r&b, and indie pop.

I often go by the pseudonym "nextonesfaster" online.

I'm always curious to work on interesting projects, so feel free to send me an email at [sujalbolia\[at\]gmail\[dot\]com](mailto:sujalbolia@gmail.com) to get in touch!
