Hi, I'm Sujalâ€”a passionate programmer and recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

I'm currently focused on personal projects while actively seeking software engineering opportunities. I'm mostly interested in machine learning problems such as natural language processing and image processing, but I also enjoy exploring algorithms and systems programming.

I've had the privilege of interning twice at Microsoft, where I worked under the guidance of Dr. Manoj Chinnakotla during the summers of 2021 and 2022. These virtual internships were invaluable, allowing me to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects, adhere to industry standards, and explore new frameworks.

I believe open-source software is critical for software development and try my best to contribute to the open-source community by using permissive licenses or contributing to other projects.

Outside of computer science, you can find me getting psyched by sci-fi books and tv shows and sports such as cricket, football, badminton, and pool. I also love watching anime, ranging from drama to psychological thrillers to comedies, going out on a good hike, and jamming out to music! My favourite genres to listen to are hip-hop, r&b, indie, and pop.

I often go by the pseudonym "nextonesfaster" online.

I'm always curious to work on interesting projects, so feel free to send me an email at [sujalbolia\[at\]gmail\[dot\]com](mailto:sujalbolia@gmail.com) to get in touch!
