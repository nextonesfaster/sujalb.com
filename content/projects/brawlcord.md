Brawlcord is a Discord bot which allows users to play a simplified version of the game [Brawl Stars](https://brawlstars.com) (developed by Supercell) on Discord. It is an instance of [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot).

The cog replicates the real game in a number of ways while adapting to the text-based form of Discord. It has the following features:

- Battle against the bot or other players for glory (and rewards)  
- Unlock and collect new, powerful Brawlers - each with a signature attack and SUPER ability
- Climb to the top of the leaderboards in global and local rankings
- Customize Brawlers with unlockable skins
- See your stats and show off to friends
